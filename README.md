## Directory Structure
- All source code can be found in the /src directory
- The /src/components holds all components

## Important Information
- Do not push code directly to the master branch, checkout dev (`git checkout dev`), then branch off dev with a descriptivley named branch (`git checkout -b feature/login-page` for example).
  - Once code is ready to be tested create a PR in Github to the dev branch. You can do this by navigating to the 'Pull Requests' tab [https://github.com/Sfullen96/spa-labour-exchange/pulls](https://github.com/Sfullen96/spa-labour-exchange/pulls) and clicking 'New Pull Request', choose `dev` as the base & your feature branch as the 'compare' branch
